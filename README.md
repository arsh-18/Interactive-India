# Interactive-India

This project aims to provide an interactive and educational tool for school students who
are unfamiliar with the location and basic information of the states in India. Through
this project, students can easily learn about the different states in India, their locations,
and key facts about each state. The interactive nature of the tool will help students to
engage with the material and retain the information more effectively. This project will
provide an efficient and enjoyable way for students to memorize important information
about the states of India, which will be useful in their studies and beyond.
This project will be a valuable resource for students who are preparing for exams
or seeking to improve their knowledge of India’s geography and culture. By making
the learning experience interactive and enjoyable, this tool will encourage students to
take an active interest in the subject matter and develop a deeper understanding of
the different states and regions of India.

 Working
Our project has an interactive display that showcases all the states of India, allowing
users to learn about their locations and key facts in a fun and engaging way. The
display is controlled through a joystick, which allows users to navigate through the
different states and select the ones they wish to learn more about.
When the joystick button is pressed, basic information about the selected state is
displayed on the screen. This information may include its capital city, population, major industries, cultural landmarks, and other important details. The display is designed
to cater to students who are unfamiliar with the states of India, as well as those who
are seeking to expand their knowledge.
To make the learning experience more interactive, each state corresponds to an LED
on the strip, which glows when that state is displayed. This feature helps students to
visually identify the state being discussed and to reinforce their learning. Additionally,
using optical fibre, that particular state is highlighted on the map, making it easier for
students to understand its geographical location in relation to other states in India
